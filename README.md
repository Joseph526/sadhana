A daily practice journal to help you achieve your goals

## About

Sadhana is a personal productivity application for making goals into habits and keeping track of daily tasks, plus a pomodoro timer for when it's time to focus. Sadhana encourages you to work towards goals by automatically generating habit goals as tasks on the days you want and creates a responsive visual record of your progress at the top of the page.
